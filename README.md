# cipher-encoder-decoder
A small pet project, essentially just making a bloated caesar cipher using the ascii table.
This is *not* to be taken as any sort of serious attempt at cryptography, and it is not to
be used in any circumstance to try and encrypt any information. This process completely fails
Kerckhoffs's principle, and just as a caesar cipher is trivial to crack once you know its
process, so too is this programs process trivial to crack.

The main "point" of this was simply coding for pleasure, as well as to simply get better at
programming. 

Included in this repository is the .java file that creates the cipher, titled scrambleTest.java
as well as the program to decipher the text, named decoder.py
